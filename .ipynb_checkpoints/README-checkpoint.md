# Group 1008 - *Meteorite Impact Tracking*

---

## Milestones

Details for Milestone are available on Canvas (left sidebar, Course Project) or [here](https://firas.moosvi.com/courses/data301/project/milestone01.html).

## Research Questions:

*To what extent does the location of a meteor affect its found versus seen status?* <br>
*Does the weight or composition of the meteor affect its found versus seen status?*

## Description of Topic:

Although there are many rationales for choosing this particular dataset, including source reliability and a plethora of unique values, our main reason routed from our group's shared interest in space and astrophysics. The three of us share a common passion for space analytics so finding this dataset was a perfect fit. While scoping the data and completing the project, we hope to find out more about meteorite landings and their geographical relationship, as well as how this data has differed over the many years of observation. A possible course of exploration could be to see if the mass of a meteorite has any direct correlation to the geographical location of the meteorite landing. Or possibly if the meteorite landings that were not observed had any relation to geographical location. Analyzing this dataset will not only be informative and interesting to us but will also be an excellent topic for a user-facing Dashboard, as there is a lot of data to analyze and extract.

## Description of Dataset:

Our dataset is a list of over **45,000 recorded meteorites**, found or observed up to 2013. The data was published by NASA but was collected by The Meteorical Society. The dataset contains values for: the name of the meteorite, its weight, its longitude and latitude, the year it was seen or found, and the category of meteorite. Additionally, each meteorite has a unique identifier code and a name given based on where and when it was found, and its composition. Our data seemingly stretches across a period of 250 years; however, a cursory examination of the data shows most of the values have been collected in the last 50 or so years. The data was collected for scientific purposes, to further the study of meteorites. As the data spans a significant number of years, the older data would have been compiled from historical texts, whereas the newer data was likely published directly to the database. Furthermore, some of the older data has been reclassified and the recommended values are given for certain datapoints rather than the original data.
